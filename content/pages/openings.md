The lab is expanding!
We is seeking undergraduate researchers, graduate students, and postdocs/research associates to start as early as Fall 2019:

## Undergraduate Researchers

The lab is seeking undergraduates interested in gaining research experience examining questions related to host-microbe interactions. 
Projects in the lab involve bench lab work (wet), computational research (dry), or a combination of both. 
Prospective researchers should be willing to make a time commitment of at least 8 hours per week to their research during the semesters. 
If interested, please send an [email](mailto:erdavenport@gmail.com) to set up a time to talk. 

## Graduate Students

The lab is seeking PhD students interested in both host-microbe interactions in evolution and disease and methods development. 
The lab accepts graduate students through multiple programs, including the [Biology Graduate Degree Program](https://bio.psu.edu/). 
Prospective students should [email me](mailto:erdavenport@gmail.com) the summer or fall before applying so that we can identify the program they should apply to. 

## Postdocs | Research Associates

The lab is seeking postdoctoral scholars and/or research associates interested broadly in questions involving host-microbe interactions, development of experimental or computational tools for microbiome research, and [insert your related interest here].
Funding is available for 2 years, with possibility of extension.
If interested, please [email me](mailto:erdavenport@gmail.com) with your interests, timeline, CV, and a recent paper (pre-prints encouraged) and we can chat about potential projects.
