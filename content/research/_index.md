Host + microbiome interactions 

We are interested in the complex relationship between the host and the microbiome.

How does the microbiome influence host health?
What is the evolutionary relationship between humans and the microbiome? 
Additionally, we are interested in method development for microbiome research more generally, including both wet lab and computational techniques.
